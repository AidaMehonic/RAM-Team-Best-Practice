# Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for my OLS project, and follows guidelines from the Mozilla training (https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/#assignment--make-a-project-roadmap).

*Goal:*

## Milestone 1: Onboarding new researchers 

* organising intro sessions
* creating and curating a Slack channel 
* writing a chapter for The Turing Way on onboarding 

## Milestone 2: Upskilling researchers in open research 

* run training sessions: intro to github, reproducibility across ASG, from zero to Binder 

## Milestone 3: Encourage collaboration through sharing 

* create github repo for ASG research
* encourage people to populate the repo 
* create an issue around data that is available etc. - maybe better if it's an md document - to duscuss with
